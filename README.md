# 💵 Banking-Application

> A hand-crafted, interactive banking simulation built entirely in vanilla JavaScript through dedicated study and practice, inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann’s course.

---

## Overview

Bankist is a banking UI that simulates basic banking operations using real-time DOM manipulation.  
This project was built from scratch as part of my deep-dive into modern JavaScript writing, refactoring, and polishing every feature to fully understand the underlying logic.

- **User:** `nnm` | **PIN:** `1234`

> The app simulates transactions for these accounts only; all data is stored in JavaScript objects.
